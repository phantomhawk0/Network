1. NETWORK DEFINITION

		
		- A group or system of interconnected people or things.” Similarly, in the computer world, the term network means two or more connected computers that can 
		  share resources such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or some combination of these.

		  These two hosts “talk” to each other using a computer language called binary code.




2. LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)


		- Local area network (LAN) is usually restricted to spanning a particular geographic location such as an office building, a single department within a 
		  corporate office, or even a home office. Back in the day, you couldn’t put more than 30 workstations on a LAN. ven so, it’s still best to split a
		  big LAN into smaller logical zones known as workgroups to make administration easier.





3. COMMON NETWORK COMPONENTS

	
		1. Workstation
		2. Server 
		3. Hosts  



		- WORKSTATION: Workstations are often seriously powerful computers that run more than one central processing unit (CPU) and whose resources are available to 
		  other users on the network to access when needed.


		- SERVER: Servers are also powerful computers. They get their name because they truly are “at the service” of the network and run specialized software 
		  known as the network operating system to maintain and control the network.

			- File Server: Stores and dispenses files
			- Mail Server The network’s post office; handles email functions
			- Print Server Manages printers on the network
			- Web Server Manages web-based activities by running Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for storing web content and accessing web pages
			- Fax Server The “memo maker” that sends and receives paperless faxes over the network
			- Application Server: Manages network applications
			- Telephony Server Handles the call center and call routing and can be thought of as a sophisticated network answering machine
			- Proxy Server Handles tasks in the place of other machines on the network, particularly an Internet connection


		- HOSTS: Host means any network device with an IP address





4. METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK (MAN) 

		- Network covering a metropolitan area is used to interconnect various buildings and facilities usually over a carrier-provided network. 




5. WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN)


		- WAN networks are what we use to span large geographic areas and truly go the distance. Like the Internet, WANs usually employ both routers and public links





6. PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (PAN)


		- For close proximity connections there are PANs or personal area networks. These are seen with smartphones and laptops in a conference room where local 
		  connections are used to collaborate and send data between devices. While a PAN can use a wired connection such as Ethernet or USB, it is more common that 
		  short distance wireless connections are used such as Bluetooth, infrared, or ZigBee.





7. CAMPUS AREA NETWORK (CAN) 


		- A CAN, or campus area network, covers a limited geographical network such as a college or corporate campus. The CAN typically interconnect LANs in various 
		  buildings and offers a Wi-Fi component for roaming users.





8. STORAGE AREA NETWORK (SAN)


		- A storage area network (SAN) is designed for and used exclusively by storage systems. SANs interconnect servers to storage arrays containing 
		  centralized banks of hard drive or similar storage media. 





9. SOFTWARE-DEFINED WIDE AREA NETWORK (SDWAN)


		- A software-defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and 
		  services and can make changes in the network based on current operations.
		  SDWANs integrate any type of transport architectures such as MPLS, LTE, and broadband Internet services to securely connect users to applications.





10. MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING (MPLS) is


		- MPLS is a switching mechanism that imposes labels (numbers) to data and then uses those labels to forward data when it arrives at the MPLS network




11. MULTIPOINT GENERIC ROUTING ENCAPSULATION (mGRE)


		- The Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation (mGRE) protocol refers to a carrier or service provider offering that dynamically creates and terminates 
		  connections to nodes on a network. mGRE is used in Dynamic Multipoint VPN deployments. The protocol enables dynamic connections without having to 
		  pre-configure static tunnel endpoints.
		  The protocol encapsulates user data, creates a VPN connection to one or many nodes and when completed, tears down the connection.




12. PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK 


		- Computers connected together in peer-to-peer networks do not have any central, or special, authority—they’re all peers, meaning that when it 
		  comes to authority, they’re all equals.





13. CLIENT-SERVER NETWORK 


		- Client-Server networks are pretty much the polar opposite of peer-to-peer networks because,in them, a single server uses a network operating system 
		  for managing the whole network.




14. PHYSICAL NETWORK TOPOLOGIES nodes


		1. Bus
		2. Star/hubs and spoke
		3. Ring 
		4. Mesh 
		5. Point-to-point
		6. Point-to-multipoint
		7. Hybrid



		1. BUS TOPOLOGY: Bus topology is a specific kind of network topology in which all of the various devices in the network are connected to a single cable or line. 
						 In general, the term refers to how various devices are set up in a network.his type of topology is the most basic one of the bunch. 
						 The bus topology consists of two distinct and terminated ends, with each of its computers connecting to one unbroken cable running its 
						 entire length. 

				- Advantage It is easy to install and is not expensive.
				- Disadvantage: Difficult to troubleshoot, change or move


		2. START/HUBS TOPOLOGY: A star (hub-and-poke) topology’s computers are connected to a central point with their own individual cables or wireless connections. 
		                        You’ll often find that central spot inhabited by a device like a hub, a switch, or an access point.

		        - Advantage: Star topology offers a lot of advantages over bus topology, making it more widely used even though it obviously requires more physical 
		                     media. One of its best features is that because each computer or network segment is connected to the central device individually, if
							 the cable fails, it only brings down the machine or network segment related to the point of failure. This makes the network much more 
							 fault-tolerant as well as a lot easier to troubleshoot. Another great thing about a star topology is that it’s a lot more scalable—all 
							 what you have to do if you want to add to it is run a new cable and connect to the machine at the core of the star.extension



					- Version: Point-to-point link and wireless





		3. RING TOPOLOGIES

				- In this type of topology, each computer is directly connected to other computers within the same network.
